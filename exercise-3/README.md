# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# cd

You use this to navigate into and around directories. In a file tree that contains `tmp1` and a nested directory `tmp2` and you are currently in tmp1, you can switch into `tmp2` by typing `cd tmp2`

* Use to change directories
    * can navigate either up with `cd ..` or down with `cd`
* With tab completion it is faster than useing a GUI to navigate a file system
